*Important Dates and Details:*

   - Last day in the current office: *31st May*. This Friday will be our
   last working day in the current office.
   - Move date possibility: In all likelihood, from Monday, 3rd June, you
   will be working out of the new premises. In case of any unforeseen delay,
   we might have a few days of WFH. Please note that this WFH period will be
   outside the allotted quota. The final call on this will be informed to you
   by the mid of this week.
   - Office Anniversary Celebrations: If for any reason, the move to the
   new office gets delayed by a couple of days, we will accordingly move
   the office anniversary celebrations too! More details on this will be
   shared along with the above update.

Action Items for Employees:

   - Ticket for support on shifting items: Please raise a ticket on Keka
   (Under Office Admin Support -&gt; Others) to indicate what items you need us
   to help in shifting to the new office. Note that shifting of Monitors and
   HDMI Cables will be taken care of.
   - Personal Items: Make sure to take any personal items you deem
   necessary (like stationery, water bottles). As this Friday is our last day
   in the current office, you will not have another opportunity to retrieve
   items after this date. If you need assistance, feel free to reach out to
   the admin team. (Raghu)
